%description
Cartographer is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor configurations.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
